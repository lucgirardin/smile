/**
 * Gaussian Process for Regression. A Gaussian process is a stochastic process
 * whose realizations consist of random values associated with every point in
 * a range of times (or of space) such that each such random variable has
 * a normal distribution. Moreover, every finite collection of those random
 * variables has a multivariate normal distribution.
 * <p>
 * A Gaussian process can be used as a prior probability distribution over
 * functions in Bayesian inference. Given any set of N points in the desired
 * domain of your functions, take a multivariate Gaussian whose covariance
 * matrix parameter is the Gram matrix of N points with some desired kernel,
 * and sample from that Gaussian. Inference of continuous values with a
 * Gaussian process prior is known as Gaussian process regression.
 * <p>
 * The fitting is performed in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space with
 * the "kernel trick". The loss function is squared-error. This also arises
 * as the kriging estimate of a Gaussian random field in spatial statistics.
 * <p>
 * A significant problem with Gaussian process prediction is that it typically
 * scales as O(n<sup>3</sup>). For large problems (e.g. n &gt; 10,000) both
 * storing the Gram matrix and solving the associated linear systems are
 * prohibitive on modern workstations. An extensive range of proposals have
 * been suggested to deal with this problem. A popular approach is the
 * reduced-rank Approximations of the Gram Matrix, known as Nystrom approximation.
 * Greedy approximation is another popular approach that uses an active set of
 * training points of size m selected from the training set of size n &gt; m.
 * We assume that it is impossible to search for the optimal subset of size m
 * due to combinatorics. The points in the active set could be selected
 * randomly, but in general we might expect better performance if the points
 * are selected greedily w.r.t. some criterion. Recently, researchers had
 * proposed relaxing the constraint that the inducing variables must be a
 * subset of training/test cases, turning the discrete selection problem
 * into one of continuous optimization.
