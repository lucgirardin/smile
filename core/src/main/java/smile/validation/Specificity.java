/**
 * Specificity (SPC) or True Negative Rate is a statistical measures of the
 * performance of a binary classification test. Specificity measures the
 * proportion of negatives which are correctly identified.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *     SPC = TN / N = TN / (FP + TN) = 1 - FPR
 * </pre>
 * Sensitivity and specificity are closely related to the concepts of type
 * I and type II errors. For any test, there is usually a trade-off between
 * the measures. This trade-off can be represented graphically using an ROC curve.
 * <p>
 * In this implementation, the class label 1 is regarded as positive and 0
 * is regarded as negative.
